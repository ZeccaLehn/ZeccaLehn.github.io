Have been wanting to explore the Jekyll static framework for some time. Decided to finally jump in and give it a try, as I have some experience in Ruby / Rails. Jekyll couples well with Github, allows for easy post updates, and is free! This site will serve as a Data Science channel for useful R and Python `code chunks`, links to useful data munging and machine learning sources, and other go-to info which will benefit the DS community.

#### For those [#Rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) folk, remember:
{% highlight ruby %}
data <- data[data]
# prints data
{% endhighlight %}
