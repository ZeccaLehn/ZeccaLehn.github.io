Thanks for connecting! This site is primarily for sharing work in one place, and also to connect with the quant focused community. My background is in Environmental Economics and Management Consulting.

My deep passion is in solving complex problems creatively using statistical programming--especially in teams. I'm a Certified Data Scientist through Johns Hopkins, and recently was invited to participate in NewMet Data's fellowship bootcamp here in sunny Los Angeles (Summer 2015).

If you want to talk business and ideas, let's connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zecca){:target="_blank"}
